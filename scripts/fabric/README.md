# Recover paused Eventstream routing

Accepted publisher sends and successful live WebSocket delivery do **not** prove
Eventhouse ingestion. Check the existing Eventstream's documented `/topology`:
`triathlon_custom_endpoint` and `triathlon_main_stream` can be `Running` while
`racesplit_stream` and `sessionmetric_stream` are `Paused`.

After verifying the workspace, Eventstream, and KQL database IDs, use PowerShell 7:

```powershell
.\scripts\fabric\resume-eventstream.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-guid>' -TenantId '<tenant-guid>' `
  -WorkspaceId '<workspace-guid>' -EventstreamId '<eventstream-guid>' `
  -KqlDatabaseId '<kql-database-item-guid>' -WhatIf
```

Remove `-WhatIf` to apply. The default `WhenLastStopped` resumes from the last
checkpoint subject to source retention. Use `-StartType Now` explicitly for a
fresh disposable-demo check; it intentionally skips previously buffered events.
The script only accepts the existing CustomEndpoint/default stream, two named
derived streams and two DirectIngestion destinations in the specified database.
It uses the eventstream-wide resume operation because this topology's only
pause/resume-capable nodes are the derived streams. It neither resets the source
nor recreates connections or changes permissions. A failure or unexpected
topology stops recovery rather than choosing an alternative destination.

`Status = Running` means the derived streams report `Running`, **not** that events
have arrived. Destination warnings are surfaced. Coordinate with other users of
the demo before generating one bounded race/session through the existing
application. Query the real table for the generated entity ID and require a
fresh ingestion timestamp plus nonzero row count; report only aggregates:

```kusto
RaceSplit
| where raceId == "<generated-race-guid>"
| summarize rows=count(), latestIngestion=max(ingestion_time()),
            latestEvent=max(timestamp)
```

Do not substitute direct Kusto ingestion, WebSocket counts, or absence of
ingestion errors for this check. Stop at any permission/credential/consent denial.
Connection strings must stay in memory and must not appear in logs or files.
